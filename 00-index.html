I am a PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vaughan/"> Dr. Richard Vaughan </a> in the <a href="http://autonomy.cs.sfu.ca/"> Autonomy Lab</a> at the <a href="http://cs.sfu.ca/">School of Computing Science</a> at Simon Fraser University (<a href="www.sfu.ca">SFU</a>). Currently, I study human-robot interaction (HRI) and my research is focused on designing multimodal interaction systems. I have developed methods for humans to get the robot's attention in simple and intuitive ways.
